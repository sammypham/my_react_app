        With a robust background spanning 7+ years in ROBLOX game development, 
        CookingVille stands as my most ambitious project yet. 
        Drawing inspiration from the immensely popular BloxBurg, 
        which boasts over 8 billion visits, this endeavor began as an 
        emulation of BloxBurg's sandbox building mechanic, itself influenced by The Sims. 
        Over time, I infused the project with my unique vision, introducing a captivating 
        minigame-based cooking mechanic and expanding upon the themes of culinary 
        exploration and foraging.

        Building System
      </h2>
      <p>
        CookingVille's innovative building system is centered around the concept of complete 
        customization. Instead of adhering to the typical 'modular' approach seen in many 
        games like Minecraft and Fortnite, where predefined blocks or pieces are assembled, 
        CookingVille offers players unparalleled freedom by allowing them to sketch out floorplans, 
        draw walls, add roofs, and place windows seamlessly within their structures. What sets this 
        system apart is its utilization of an intricate grid system, akin to design software like 
        SketchUp or the architectural creativity found in The Sims, enabling players to design 
        structures exactly to their liking. Additionally, a diverse selection of furniture further 
        enriches the building experience, catering to a wide range of roleplay scenarios and 
        imaginative creations.

        I adopted a fresh approach to game mechanics by introducing a highly interactive cooking 
        experience. Unlike many games that offer simplistic crafting mechanics, where players merely 
        gather materials and click to produce items, CookingVille elevates the process with engaging 
        mini-games. Picture this: when crafting a recipe, players are not simply passive observers. They're 
        challenged to chop, stir, season, and do whatever the recipe calls for. These intuitive mini-games 
        not only add more engagement but also deepen the sense of accomplishment as players skillfully navigate 
        each step of the cooking process.

        UI/UX & 3D Modeling
      </h2>
      <p>
        All UI/UX was designed by me as well as in-game assets and animations! I learned to use 
        Adobe Illustrator & Photoshop to create all the icons and textures needed in CookingVille 
        and used Blender to design low-poly game assets and their 3D renders.
